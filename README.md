# Selim.io

Selim.io is a personal assistant which interprets the user's speech and uses natural language processing to construct 
the appropriate responses to users regarding their music preferences. The responses contain information on upcoming
events in their area, upcoming new releases from all of their favourite artists and recommendations on new artists
based on their preferences.

Selim.io is developed for linux distributions and can easily be incorporated into a raspberry pi system with 
microphone and speaker capabilities.

To install Selim, run the 'install.sh' in a unix terminal with sudo privilages. This will install all the dependencies 
that are needed to run the application
